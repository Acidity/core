h2(#installation). %2.% Installation

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "core":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

You will require a current "WebCore":http://www.web-core.org/ installation.  The following line will create a new Python virtual environment folder called "brave" in your current working directory, then activate the virtual environment.

<pre><code>curl get.web-core.org | python - brave
cd brave
. bin/activate</code></pre>

Additionally, there are two requirements you will need to manually install as Core Services require features present in as-yet unreleased packages.  You will need to perform the following steps:

<pre><code>(git clone git@github.com:marrow/marrow.templating.git; cd marrow.templating; python setup.py develop)
(git clone git@github.com:marrow/marrow.tags.git; cd marrow.tags; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

Installing the current development version of the Core Service requires "Git":git, a distributed source code management system.  If you have Git, you can run the following to download and _link_ the development version into your Python runtime:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/bravecollective/core.git
(cd core; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:

<pre><code>(cd core; git pull; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information, see "GitHub's documentation":github-help.

fn1. In order to run the full test suite you need to install "pymta":http://www.schwarz.eu/opensource/projects/pymta/ and its dependencies.

fn2. If "Pip":http://www.pip-installer.org/ is not available for you, you can use @easy_install@ instead. We have much love for Pip and "Distribute":http://packages.python.org/distribute/, though.
